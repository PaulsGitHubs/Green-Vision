# Green-Vision
Illustration of processing for light spectrums in the Green: 495–570 nm wavelength.


## WHY GREEN?
### There is no wavelength assigned to indigo. If you want a number, it's around 445 nanometers, but it doesn't appear on most spectra. There's a reason for this. English mathematician Isaac Newton (1643–1727) coined the word spectrum (Latin for "appearance") in his 1671 book "Opticks." He divided the spectrum into seven sections—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—in keeping with the Greek sophists, to connect the colors to days of the week, musical notes, and the known objects of the solar system.

### So, the spectrum was first described with seven colors, but most people, even if they see color well, can't actually distinguish indigo from blue or violet. The modern spectrum typically omits indigo. In fact, there is evidence Newton's division of the spectrum doesn't even correspond to the colors we define by wavelengths. For example, Newton's indigo is the modern blue, while his blue corresponds to the color we refer to as cyan. Is your blue the same as my blue? Probably, but it may not be the same as Newton's.

### Draw the lines for the color Green, visible spectra in the natural world (nature), light patterns, and inherent natural processing simplicity.

## Can green tell us more about the world? Help us process it faster?

### Yes, it can.

### Green is actually used in special night vision for better visibility? Why? Because the spectra of light for which eminates from light reflections is greater than in other colors.

### Special phenomena also arises from photoelectic effects and blue spectra light and electrical circuits.

## Objectives
- **Develop and refine algorithms** that enhance, filter, and detect features in images within the green light spectrum.
- **Simulate green light conditions** in standard images to test algorithm effectiveness.
- **Provide tools and scripts** for researchers and developers working in environments where green light is predominant.
